 Okay. Thank you.
 Apparently there is only $57 left in your account.
 You can't be serious!
 That's what my records show.
 I see. Thanks for your help.

I need help with the office party.
 Yes, of course. We could split it. What part would you like to do, the food or the entertainment?
 I have no idea what the entertainment should be.
 Let's make sure we are on the same page. Do we want a formal or informal gathering?
 Let's make it a formal affair.
 Yes, that would be best. Now, for food should we have Chinese or American food?
 American food would be the best choice.
 That would be great. What kind of music would you like, a band or recorded music?
 We should bring in a really good DJ.
 That works for me. Let's see what we can each do about planning our part and meet again on Friday.
Would you help me figure out what to do about the office party?
 I would be happy to help. What would you like me to help with, food or entertainment?
 I would like to help you with both.
 That will work out fine. To make sure everything goes together, do you think this party should be casual or dressy?
 A dressy party would be fun!
 That will work out fine. Do you think that Chinese or Continental food would be best?
 We should probably have both.
 Yes, that will work out fine. Should we hire a band or bring in a DJ?
 Maybe we could do both!
 Everything sounds great then! I'll meet you back here on Friday to discuss the details.
I was wondering if you need any help on your new project.
 Sure! That would be great! Are you good at writing or would you rather do the computer work?
 I would like to help with the computer work.
 Great! We are going to be working in teams of three. Are you OK working with others?
 Yes, I like working like that.
 We will begin next Monday. Would you be available then?
 Yes, I can be there.
 Well, if you could send me your basic background information before next Monday, it would be useful.
 I will send the information to you.
 Well then, thanks for your help. Have a great day!
Would you like me to help you on your new project?
 I would love the help! Would you prefer helping with the writing part or is programming more your thing?
 I would enjoy helping with the writing portion.
 Perfect! You'll be working alone on that portion. Do you like to work alone?
 That is OK sometimes.
 Our first meeting is next Monday. Could you meet with us at that time?
 No, I can't be there.
 Please send me your background information before the meeting so I can look at it.
 I can send that information to you.
 OK. I look forward to working with you. Enjoy your week!
Could I help you on your new project?
 I have a need for help with writing and also a need for help with the computer work. Which would you prefer?
 I want to help with both.
 That would be wonderful. Sometimes we will be working together and sometimes independently. Would that be OK?
 Most of the time that is what I prefer.
 We start on Monday. Can you be there?
 I am not sure yet.
 I need your background information before the meeting.
 I will do that.
 I'll enjoy working with you. Have a great day!
I need help preparing for my presentation on Friday.
 I could help you with that.
 Are you sure you have the time?
 I promise you that I have the time to do this. If I didn't, I wouldn't offer to help.
 What would be the best time for you to help me?
 Tomorrow night would work for me.
 Should we just meet here?
 OK, and I'll bring some information that helped me with my presentation.
 I'll see you then.
 See you tomorrow night.
Could you help me prepare for my presentation on Friday?
 I would love to help you prepare for your presentation.
 I hate to ask you to do something like that.
 This will not interfere with my work. I promise you that.
 When could we get together?
 I could easily give you some time tomorrow night.
 Would you like to meet at the coffee house next door?
 Yes, and could you write down anything you might be having trouble with?
 I'll come prepared.
 Goodbye until then. I promise you that you'll do well after we meet.
I am a little nervous about my presentation on Friday.
 If you would like me to, I could help you with that.
 Wouldn't that take you away from your project?
 I have plenty of time to do this. I promise you it won't be a problem for me.
 Is there a good time for you to help me?
 If we work on this tomorrow night, you could easily be ready for Friday.
 How about meeting in my office?
 That would work out well. Bring any concerns that you might have.
 Sounds like you'll be able to help me a lot.
 Don't worry. Everything will go well. I promise!
Whoa, look at all those ice cream choices!
 Yes, that is a lot of choices. What is your favorite?
 I love anything with chocolate the best.
 I like chocolate myself.
 Is there any kind of ice cream you don't like?
 I really don't like any ice cream with nuts in it.
 I haven't ever cared for that myself.
 Have you ever had garlic ice cream?
 That sounds absolutely disgusting!
 It was. Let's stick with the regular choices today, though.
How are you doing today?
 I'm fine.
 What can I do for you?
 I would like to cancel a check.
 Is there a problem?
 I wrote the check out for too much.
 How much did you write it out for?
 I wrote it out for $150.
 How much was it supposed to be?
 It was supposed to be for $100.
 I'll cancel that check for you.
 I really appreciate your help.
How are you?
 I'm doing well.
 How may I help you?
 Could you cancel a check for me?
 What's the problem?
 I wrote the check out for way too much.
 How much?
 I wrote the check out for $150.
 What were you supposed to write it out for?
 I was supposed to write the check out for $100.
 I'll just cancel it for you right now.
 That's great. You're a lifesaver.
How's it going?
 Great. Thank you.
 What can I help you with?
 I need to cancel a check.
 What's wrong with the check?
 I accidentally wrote the check for too much.
 How much did you write the check for?
 The check was written for $150.
 How much were you supposed to write it for?
 I needed to write it for $100.
 I can cancel it for you right now.
 Thank you so much.
What can I help you with today?
 I would like to make a deposit.
 Will that be cash or check?
 I'm depositing a check.
 Could you sign the back of the check, please?
 All right. Here you go.
 Would you like any cash back?
 That would be great.
 How much would you like?
 I would like $150.
 Here is your $150.
 Thanks for everything.
How may I help you?
 I'm making a deposit today.
 Cash or check?
 I would like to deposit a check.
 You need to sign the back.
 Okay. Here you go.

 I want $150.
 Here is your $150.
 Thank you, and have a nice day.
Can I help you with something?
 I need to cancel one of my accounts.
 Is there a problem with it?
 I don't need it anymore.
 What would you like to do with all the money in this account?
 Just transfer it over to my remaining account.
 I can do that.
 That would be great.
 Do you want to take any money out?
 Not today.
 It's going to take a moment for me to cancel your account.
 That's fine. Take your time.
What can I do for you?
 I would like to cancel one of my accounts.
 Is there a problem with your account?
 I only need one.
 What about all your money in that account?
 Could you please transfer that money to my remaining account?
 That's fine.
 I appreciate it.
 Would you like to make a withdrawal?
 That's all for today.
 I'll just cancel your account right now.
 I greatly appreciate your help.
Did you need help with something?
 I need to cancel an account.
 Do you have a problem with your account?
 I don't need two different accounts anymore.
 What are you going to do about the money in your account?
 Can I transfer it to my remaining account?
 I'll do that for you.
 That's lovely.
 Would you like to withdraw any money?
 No. That's fine.
 It'll just take me a moment to cancel your account.
 Thank you very much.
Do you have any other questions?
 I want to know about fees.
 Which fees?
 Overdraft fees.
 You will be required to pay a small fee for every time you overdraft.
 How much is the fee?
 You'll have to pay $25 every time you overdraft.
 That's a small fee?
 It should stop you from overdrafting.
 You would think it would, but it most likely won't.
 Can I help you with anything else?
 That's it for today. Thank you.
Do you have any questions?
 Tell me about fees.
 What fees are you referring to?
 I want to know about overdraft fees.
 We charge a small fee every time you overdraft.
 How much?
 For each time you overdraft, you have to pay $25.
 That's not a small fee.
 You shouldn't overdraft.
 That's for sure.
 Do you need help with anything else?
 That's all I needed to know. Thanks.
Would you like to ask any questions?
 I need to know about the fees.
 What kind of fees?
 I'm asking about overdraft fees.
 You have to pay a small fee every time you overdraft.
 What's the fee?
 The fee is $25 every time you overdraft.
 How is that a small fee?
 That fee should keep you from overdrafting.
 I'll say.
 Do you have any more questions?
 I don't need to know anything else. Thank you.
There are so many flavors of ice cream to choose from!
 Yes, there must be about a hundred. Do you have a favorite?
 I love fruit flavored ices the best.
 Yes, fresh fruit flavored is the best ever.
 What is your least favorite ice cream?
 I don't like peppermint ice cream.
 Yes, I know what you mean.
 One time, I tried garlic ice cream.
 That could be interesting.
 That doesn't sound like a good choice for today. Let's order!
I have never seen so many flavors of ice cream in one place!
 There certainly are a lot. Can you choose a favorite?
 Vanilla with toppings is my favorite.
 Is there anything as good as a hot fudge sundae?
 No way!
 I don't like ice cream with too many different flavors in it.
 I agree with that, it just doesn't work for me.
 I saw garlic ice cream on the menu once.
 I think that that would be horrible!
 I think I'll stick with a more traditional choice today!
I was thinking about applying for the new position.
 Do you think that is a good idea?
 It seems like a good idea but I am not really sure.
 What are your main concerns?
 It would give me a chance to grow, but I am wondering if I would like the job.
 I know what you mean, I've thought about that myself.
 I also am thinking about the pay.
 Could you take a slight pay decrease for a chance to move forward?
 Yes, it might be worth it. I am not certain.
 I think I'm convinced that trying for this position is the best choice for you.
I am not certain, but I think I might ask to be considered for the new job.
 Why are you considering trying for it?
 I think that I might like it, but I am still thinking about it.
 What is it about this job that appeals to you?
 I think that I would enjoy the position but there isn't a lot of creativity involved.
 Yes, you could be right. There is a lot to consider.
 I am also wondering about the pay.
 Would a slight decrease in pay be worth it for a new opportunity for growth?
 I am thinking that might be the case.
 I think you should give it a shot. What do you have to lose? You can always change your mind.
I am considering going for the new job that was posted yesterday.
 Are you certain that that is what you want to do.
 It may not be the best choice for me, but I am considering it.
 Why do you think that this would be a good move?
 I believe that this job would allow me to move up but might be a little boring for me.
 Yes, there are always pros and cons to making a career change.
 Also, the matter of pay is also a consideration.
 I think the slight pay decrease might be worth it. The benefits are much better.
 Yes, sometimes giving up a little to move forward is the best choice.
 I think you definitely should apply for the position.
I was thinking of holding the company retreat in the mountains.
 I agree, I think that that would be perfect!
 I was thinking it could take place sometime in January.
 That might be a little too cold for some people.
 Yes, you are right.
 What about April? April has good weather that isn't too cold or too hot.
 Yes, that would work out better.
 You know, maybe we could take a survey to see how that works for everyone.
 Good idea! We'll have to get right on it.
 Fine! Well, I'll get right on it now!
I think that the company retreat should be in the mountains this year.
 What a great idea!
 January would be a good month for a mountain retreat.
 I like the mountain idea, but I am not so sure about the month of January.
 You know, now that I think about it, you might be right.
 April might be nice. It is far enough away to make the necessary arrangements.
 That is a good suggestion.
 We could ask everyone what would be the best time for them.
 Yes, that would let us know what would work best.
 I'll put the survey online this afternoon.
The Mountains would be a great place for the company retreat.
 That's a wonderful choice.
 I have chosen January as the month for this retreat.
 January is a little too close to the Christmas holidays.
 Yes, maybe another choice might be better.
 I think that April would work. Spring is a lovely time to be in the mountains.
 Thank you for thinking of that.
 Maybe if we asked around we could see what people would prefer.
 That is a good idea.
 I'll take care of taking the survey and get back to you with the answers.
  I was wondering if I could borrow the company van for a fundraiser this weekend.
 Sure, I think that would be possible. Where is the fundraiser?
 It is in the park downtown.
 Would you need it for both Saturday and Sunday?
 We will need it for Saturday only.
 I think that would be OK. Who will be driving it?
 Mary and I will be driving the van.
 Could you drop it off on Sunday night?
 Yes, we can do that. Can we borrow the chairs from the lunchroom also?
 Yes, that would be fine. Just make sure that everything is returned by Sunday night.
Our unit is participating in a fundraiser this weekend and would like to borrow the van, if possible.
 I would need to check on that. Where is the fundraiser?
 It will be at the beach by the pier.
 What day will you need it for?
 We will only be needing it for Sunday.
 Maybe that could work. I need to know who will be driving it.
 The only two drivers will be Mary and I.
 If I give you the keys to the garage, could you bring it back on Sunday evening?
 Sure. We also would like to use the chairs from the lunchroom. Would that be OK?
 OK, but make sure that everything is back by Sunday night at the latest.
Could we borrow the company van for a fundraiser this weekend?
 That would be a possibility. Where is this fundraiser taking place?
 It is in the hotel ballroom down the street.
 Do you need it for the whole weekend?
 We will need it for both days.
 We will need to know who will be driving the van.
 The van will be driven by Mary and me.
 It needs to be back on Sunday night. Can you arrange for that?
 Yes, no problem. Would you mind if we borrowed a few of the chairs from the lunchroom?
 Just keep track of everything and get it all back where you took it from by Sunday evening.
Your total comes to $36.78.
 Put it on my VISA.
 There's a problem with your card.
 What's wrong with it?
 I believe it was declined.
 You're kidding me!
 Do you have another card I could try?
 I only have one card.
 Do you have cash, perhaps?
 I don't have any cash on me.
 You're not going to be able to take these items today.
 I'll be back tomorrow.
The total for all these items comes to $36.78.
 Take my VISA.
 There is something wrong with your card.
 What's going on?
 Your card was declined.
 That can't be right!
 Would you like me to try another card?
 I don't have another one.
 What about cash?
 I didn't bring cash with me today.
 I'm sorry, but you can't take the items until you can buy them.
 I'll come back for them tomorrow.
You owe $36.78.
 Here's my VISA card.
 I'm sorry, but your card isn't working.
 What's the problem?
 The machine says your card was declined.
 It was?
 Do you have another card?
 That's my only one.
 Maybe you can just pay in cash?
 No cash today.
 I guess you won't be able to purchase these items today.
 I'll come tomorrow with cash.
I need to use the ATM.
 What's stopping you?
 I'm not sure how.
 I don't understand.
 I've never used one before.
 I can help you figure it out.
 What do I have to do?
 Slide your card into the machine.
 Then what?
 You need to type your PIN in.
 What do I have to do next?
 Click on whichever option you want, and you're done.
I have to use the ATM.

 I don't know how to use it.
 What are you talking about?
 I have never used an ATM before.
 I can show you how to use it.
 How do I use it?
 You need to push your card into the machine.
 What's next?
 Enter your PIN.
 What else do I have to do?
 Every option you can choose will appear on the screen. That's about it.
I need to go to the ATM.
 So, why don't you?
 I have no idea how to use the ATM.
 What do you mean?
 This will be my first time using an ATM.
 I can help you with that.
 Explain to me how to use it.
 Just put your card into the machine.
 Now what do I do?
 Then you need to type in your PIN.
 Now what?
 Just click on one of the choices they give you, and that's it.
How may I help you?
 I'm having a problem.
 What is it?
 I apparently owe some fees, but I never got the bank statement.
 I do apologize for that.
 My fees went up, but I didn't even know I had fees to pay. 
 I see your problem.
 What are you going to do about it?
 I will cancel the fees you owe.
 I don't have to pay any fees?
 You'll only have to pay the initial fee.
 That's fine. I appreciate your help.
What can I do for you?
 I have a serious problem.
 Explain it to me.
 I never got a bank statement for fees that I owe.
 I'm sorry, but I guess we didn't send a statement out.
 My fees increased, because I didn't know about my fees. 
 I see where that is a problem.
 Can you fix it?
 I will cancel the fees that you owe.
 You're canceling all the fees?
 You still need to pay the initial fee.
 That'll be fine.
May I help you?
 I have a problem.
 What's your problem?
 I owe fees, but a bank statement never came in the mail about it.
 I apologize for the inconvenience.
 I have no idea about the fee, so my fees went up. 
 I understand your problem.
 Will you be able to solve my problem?
 I'm going to cancel the fees you owe.
 So, I don't have to pay any of it?
 The initial fee still must be paid.
 That's fabulous. Thank you very much.
I would like to open an account today.
 What kind?
 I want to open a checking account.
 You need to keep a minimum balance.
 How much is it?
 You need at least $100 in your account.
 Is that all?
 Yes. That's the minimum.

 You will get a fine.
 How much?
 It's going to be $25.
I need to open an account.
 Do you know what kind you want to open?
 I want a checking account.
 Do you know what the minimum balance is?
 What is that?
 You need to keep it at $100.
 That's it?
 That's the least amount you can have.
 What'll happen if I don't maintain that?
 We will fine you.
 How much will I be fined?
 You will be fined $25.
I want to open an account.
 What kind of account do you want to open?

 Really?
