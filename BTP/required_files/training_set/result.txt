was depressed and miserable for not getting admissions in better colleges and being the only one among my Inter classmates to join a state level college. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
I never appreciated the college much. I always thought that this not the place for me and tried to induce my misery all around. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Unnecessarily troubled the lecturers, never listened to them,made fun of them,ignored them completely and what not. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I was always told that this kind of attitude will get me nowhere.But I  didnt care, always took those comments as a challenge. \Statement_opinion_[sv]
In fact I did do well enough to shove it in their face, never had a single backlog through out with a distinction, got placed in an MNC,got an admission from a graduate school and a ticket to US. \Statement_opinion_[sv]
But in retrospect , I regret for having behaved the way I did in my B.Tech.Even though as it may appear that I may have proved people wrong, the journey towards success begins now i.e after graduation and nothing else. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
So, you never know. \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
Something bad may really happen eventually. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Always respect lecturers and their opinions in order to have a sound sleep for the rest of your life after B.Tech. \Statement_opinion_[sv]
You are always responsible for the outcome of your actions \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
Nobody goes to the US with the idea of coming back..atleast majority don't.. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]

In that case, I didn’t do my homework. \Or_clause_[qrr]
I'm miss having friends that would just sit with me and be bored with each other. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
There are lots of days where I would just rather hang out with 1 or 2 people and be "lame"…watch movies, share you tubes videos, and all that stuff. \Statement_opinion_[sv]
But everyone I hang out with likes being in a big group whenever they do things and always have to be entertained. \Statement_opinion_[sv]
It's too much for me but sometimes I feel like it's too late to make any other friends since everyone else already found their friends groups.. \3rd_Party_Talk_[t3]
