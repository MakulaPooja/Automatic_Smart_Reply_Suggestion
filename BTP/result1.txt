I think so. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Let me check that for you right now. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Okay. Thank you. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Apparently there is only $57 left in your account. \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
You can't be serious! \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That's what my records show. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I see. Thanks for your help. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
How may I help you? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
There's a problem with my check. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What problem? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
My check for $100 bounced. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Are you sure you have $100 in your checking account? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I thought I did. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I'll check for you. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Thank you very much. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
It looks like you only have $57 left in your account. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]

No. That's everything. Thank you. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I need help with the office party. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Yes, of course. We could split it. What part would you like to do, the food or the entertainment? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I have no idea what the entertainment should be. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Let's make sure we are on the same page. Do we want a formal or informal gathering? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Let's make it a formal affair. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Yes, that would be best. Now, for food should we have Chinese or American food? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
American food would be the best choice. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That would be great. What kind of music would you like, a band or recorded music? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
We should bring in a really good DJ. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That works for me. Let's see what we can each do about planning our part and meet again on Friday. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
Would you help me figure out what to do about the office party? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I would be happy to help. What would you like me to help with, food or entertainment? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I would like to help you with both. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That will work out fine. To make sure everything goes together, do you think this party should be casual or dressy? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
A dressy party would be fun! \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That will work out fine. Do you think that Chinese or Continental food would be best? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
We should probably have both. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Yes, that will work out fine. Should we hire a band or bring in a DJ? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Maybe we could do both! \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Everything sounds great then! I'll meet you back here on Friday to discuss the details. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I was wondering if you need any help on your new project. \Yes_No_Question_[qy]
Sure! That would be great! Are you good at writing or would you rather do the computer work? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I would like to help with the computer work. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Great! We are going to be working in teams of three. Are you OK working with others? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Yes, I like working like that. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
We will begin next Monday. Would you be available then? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Yes, I can be there. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
Well, if you could send me your basic background information before next Monday, it would be useful. \Yes_No_Question_[qy]
I will send the information to you. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Well then, thanks for your help. Have a great day! \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
Would you like me to help you on your new project? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I would love the help! Would you prefer helping with the writing part or is programming more your thing? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
I would enjoy helping with the writing portion. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Perfect! You'll be working alone on that portion. Do you like to work alone? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That is OK sometimes. \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
Our first meeting is next Monday. Could you meet with us at that time? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
No, I can't be there. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Please send me your background information before the meeting so I can look at it. \Appreciation_[ba]
I can send that information to you. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
OK. I look forward to working with you. Enjoy your week! \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Could I help you on your new project? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I have a need for help with writing and also a need for help with the computer work. Which would you prefer? \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
I want to help with both. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That would be wonderful. Sometimes we will be working together and sometimes independently. Would that be OK? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Most of the time that is what I prefer. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
We start on Monday. Can you be there? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
I am not sure yet. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I need your background information before the meeting. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I will do that. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I'll enjoy working with you. Have a great day! \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
I need help preparing for my presentation on Friday. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I could help you with that. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Are you sure you have the time? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I promise you that I have the time to do this. If I didn't, I wouldn't offer to help. \Yes_No_Question_[qy]
What would be the best time for you to help me? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Tomorrow night would work for me. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Should we just meet here? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
OK, and I'll bring some information that helped me with my presentation. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I'll see you then. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
See you tomorrow night. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Could you help me prepare for my presentation on Friday? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I would love to help you prepare for your presentation. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I hate to ask you to do something like that. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
This will not interfere with my work. I promise you that. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
When could we get together? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I could easily give you some time tomorrow night. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Would you like to meet at the coffee house next door? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Yes, and could you write down anything you might be having trouble with? \Yes_No_Question_[qy]
I'll come prepared. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Goodbye until then. I promise you that you'll do well after we meet. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I am a little nervous about my presentation on Friday. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
If you would like me to, I could help you with that. \Yes_No_Question_[qy]
Wouldn't that take you away from your project? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I have plenty of time to do this. I promise you it won't be a problem for me. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
Is there a good time for you to help me? \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
If we work on this tomorrow night, you could easily be ready for Friday. \Yes_No_Question_[qy]
How about meeting in my office? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That would work out well. Bring any concerns that you might have. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Sounds like you'll be able to help me a lot. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Don't worry. Everything will go well. I promise! \Statement_opinion_[sv]
Whoa, look at all those ice cream choices! \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Yes, that is a lot of choices. What is your favorite? \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
I love anything with chocolate the best. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I like chocolate myself. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Is there any kind of ice cream you don't like? \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
I really don't like any ice cream with nuts in it. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I haven't ever cared for that myself. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Have you ever had garlic ice cream? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That sounds absolutely disgusting! \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
It was. Let's stick with the regular choices today, though. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
How are you doing today? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I'm fine. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What can I do for you? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
I would like to cancel a check. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Is there a problem? \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
I wrote the check out for too much. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
How much did you write it out for? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I wrote it out for $150. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
How much was it supposed to be? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
It was supposed to be for $100. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I'll cancel that check for you. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I really appreciate your help. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
How are you? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I'm doing well. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
How may I help you? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Could you cancel a check for me? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What's the problem? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I wrote the check out for way too much. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
How much? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I wrote the check out for $150. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What were you supposed to write it out for? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I was supposed to write the check out for $100. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I'll just cancel it for you right now. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That's great. You're a lifesaver. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
How's it going? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Great. Thank you. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]

Thank you, and have a nice day. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
Can I help you with something? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
I need to cancel one of my accounts. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Is there a problem with it? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
I don't need it anymore. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What would you like to do with all the money in this account? \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Just transfer it over to my remaining account. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I can do that. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
That would be great. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Do you want to take any money out? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Not today. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
It's going to take a moment for me to cancel your account. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That's fine. Take your time. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What can I do for you? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
I would like to cancel one of my accounts. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Is there a problem with your account? \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
I only need one. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What about all your money in that account? \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Could you please transfer that money to my remaining account? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]

Do you have any other questions? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I want to know about fees. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Which fees? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Overdraft fees. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
You will be required to pay a small fee for every time you overdraft. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
How much is the fee? \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
You'll have to pay $25 every time you overdraft. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That's a small fee? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
It should stop you from overdrafting. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
You would think it would, but it most likely won't. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Can I help you with anything else? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
That's it for today. Thank you. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Do you have any questions? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Tell me about fees. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]

I want to know about overdraft fees. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
We charge a small fee every time you overdraft. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
How much? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
For each time you overdraft, you have to pay $25. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That's not a small fee. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
You shouldn't overdraft. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That's for sure. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Do you need help with anything else? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That's all I needed to know. Thanks. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Would you like to ask any questions? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I need to know about the fees. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What kind of fees? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I'm asking about overdraft fees. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
You have to pay a small fee every time you overdraft. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What's the fee? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
The fee is $25 every time you overdraft. \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
How is that a small fee? \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
That fee should keep you from overdrafting. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I'll say. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Do you have any more questions? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I don't need to know anything else. Thank you. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
There are so many flavors of ice cream to choose from! \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Yes, there must be about a hundred. Do you have a favorite? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
I love fruit flavored ices the best. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Yes, fresh fruit flavored is the best ever. \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
What is your least favorite ice cream? \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
I don't like peppermint ice cream. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Yes, I know what you mean. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
One time, I tried garlic ice cream. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That could be interesting. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That doesn't sound like a good choice for today. Let's order! \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I have never seen so many flavors of ice cream in one place! \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
There certainly are a lot. Can you choose a favorite? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
Vanilla with toppings is my favorite. \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
Is there anything as good as a hot fudge sundae? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
No way! \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I don't like ice cream with too many different flavors in it. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I agree with that, it just doesn't work for me. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I saw garlic ice cream on the menu once. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I think that that would be horrible! \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I think I'll stick with a more traditional choice today! \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I was thinking about applying for the new position. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Do you think that is a good idea? \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
It seems like a good idea but I am not really sure. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
What are your main concerns? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
It would give me a chance to grow, but I am wondering if I would like the job. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
I know what you mean, I've thought about that myself. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I also am thinking about the pay. \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
Could you take a slight pay decrease for a chance to move forward? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Yes, it might be worth it. I am not certain. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I think I'm convinced that trying for this position is the best choice for you. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
I am not certain, but I think I might ask to be considered for the new job. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Why are you considering trying for it? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I think that I might like it, but I am still thinking about it. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
What is it about this job that appeals to you? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
I think that I would enjoy the position but there isn't a lot of creativity involved. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Yes, you could be right. There is a lot to consider. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
I am also wondering about the pay. \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
Would a slight decrease in pay be worth it for a new opportunity for growth? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I am thinking that might be the case. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I think you should give it a shot. What do you have to lose? You can always change your mind. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
I am considering going for the new job that was posted yesterday. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Are you certain that that is what you want to do. \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
It may not be the best choice for me, but I am considering it. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Why do you think that this would be a good move? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I believe that this job would allow me to move up but might be a little boring for me. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Yes, there are always pros and cons to making a career change. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
Also, the matter of pay is also a consideration. \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
I think the slight pay decrease might be worth it. The benefits are much better. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Yes, sometimes giving up a little to move forward is the best choice. \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
I think you definitely should apply for the position. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I was thinking of holding the company retreat in the mountains. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I agree, I think that that would be perfect! \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I was thinking it could take place sometime in January. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That might be a little too cold for some people. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Yes, you are right. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What about April? April has good weather that isn't too cold or too hot. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Yes, that would work out better. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
You know, maybe we could take a survey to see how that works for everyone. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Good idea! We'll have to get right on it. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Fine! Well, I'll get right on it now! \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I think that the company retreat should be in the mountains this year. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What a great idea! \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
January would be a good month for a mountain retreat. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I like the mountain idea, but I am not so sure about the month of January. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
You know, now that I think about it, you might be right. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
April might be nice. It is far enough away to make the necessary arrangements. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
That is a good suggestion. \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
We could ask everyone what would be the best time for them. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Yes, that would let us know what would work best. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I'll put the survey online this afternoon. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
The Mountains would be a great place for the company retreat. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That's a wonderful choice. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I have chosen January as the month for this retreat. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
January is a little too close to the Christmas holidays. \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
Yes, maybe another choice might be better. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I think that April would work. Spring is a lovely time to be in the mountains. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
Thank you for thinking of that. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Maybe if we asked around we could see what people would prefer. \Yes_No_Question_[qy]
That is a good idea. \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
I'll take care of taking the survey and get back to you with the answers. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I was wondering if I could borrow the company van for a fundraiser this weekend. \Yes_No_Question_[qy]
Sure, I think that would be possible. Where is the fundraiser? \Open_Question_[qo]
It is in the park downtown. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
Would you need it for both Saturday and Sunday? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
We will need it for Saturday only. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I think that would be OK. Who will be driving it? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Mary and I will be driving the van. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Could you drop it off on Sunday night? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Yes, we can do that. Can we borrow the chairs from the lunchroom also? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
Yes, that would be fine. Just make sure that everything is returned by Sunday night. \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
Our unit is participating in a fundraiser this weekend and would like to borrow the van, if possible. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
I would need to check on that. Where is the fundraiser? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
It will be at the beach by the pier. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What day will you need it for? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
We will only be needing it for Sunday. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Maybe that could work. I need to know who will be driving it. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
The only two drivers will be Mary and I. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
If I give you the keys to the garage, could you bring it back on Sunday evening? \Yes_No_Question_[qy]
Sure. We also would like to use the chairs from the lunchroom. Would that be OK? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
OK, but make sure that everything is back by Sunday night at the latest. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
Could we borrow the company van for a fundraiser this weekend? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That would be a possibility. Where is this fundraiser taking place? \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
It is in the hotel ballroom down the street. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
Do you need it for the whole weekend? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
We will need it for both days. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
We will need to know who will be driving the van. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
The van will be driven by Mary and me. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
It needs to be back on Sunday night. Can you arrange for that? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
Yes, no problem. Would you mind if we borrowed a few of the chairs from the lunchroom? \Yes_No_Question_[qy]
Just keep track of everything and get it all back where you took it from by Sunday evening. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Your total comes to $36.78. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Put it on my VISA. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
There's a problem with your card. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What's wrong with it? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I believe it was declined. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
You're kidding me! \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Do you have another card I could try? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I only have one card. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Do you have cash, perhaps? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I don't have any cash on me. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
You're not going to be able to take these items today. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I'll be back tomorrow. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
The total for all these items comes to $36.78. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Take my VISA. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
There is something wrong with your card. \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
What's going on? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Your card was declined. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That can't be right! \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Would you like me to try another card? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I don't have another one. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What about cash? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I didn't bring cash with me today. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I'm sorry, but you can't take the items until you can buy them. \Other_answers_[no]
I'll come back for them tomorrow. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
You owe $36.78. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Here's my VISA card. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I'm sorry, but your card isn't working. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What's the problem? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
The machine says your card was declined. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
It was? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Do you have another card? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That's my only one. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Maybe you can just pay in cash? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
No cash today. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I guess you won't be able to purchase these items today. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I'll come tomorrow with cash. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I need to use the ATM. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What's stopping you? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I'm not sure how. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I don't understand. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I've never used one before. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I can help you figure it out. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
What do I have to do? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Slide your card into the machine. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Then what? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
You need to type your PIN in. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What do I have to do next? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Click on whichever option you want, and you're done. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I have to use the ATM. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Is there a problem? \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
I don't know how to use it. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What are you talking about? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I have never used an ATM before. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I can show you how to use it. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
How do I use it? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
You need to push your card into the machine. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What's next? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Enter your PIN. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What else do I have to do? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Every option you can choose will appear on the screen. That's about it. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
I need to go to the ATM. \Statement_opinion_[sv]
So, why don't you? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I have no idea how to use the ATM. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What do you mean? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
This will be my first time using an ATM. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I can help you with that. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
Explain to me how to use it. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Just put your card into the machine. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Now what do I do? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Then you need to type in your PIN. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Now what? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Just click on one of the choices they give you, and that's it. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
How may I help you? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I'm having a problem. \Yes_No_Question_[qy]
What is it? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
I apparently owe some fees, but I never got the bank statement. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I do apologize for that. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
My fees went up, but I didn't even know I had fees to pay. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I see your problem. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What are you going to do about it? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I will cancel the fees you owe. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I don't have to pay any fees? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
You'll only have to pay the initial fee. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That's fine. I appreciate your help. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What can I do for you? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
I have a serious problem. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Explain it to me. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I never got a bank statement for fees that I owe. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I'm sorry, but I guess we didn't send a statement out. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
My fees increased, because I didn't know about my fees. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I see where that is a problem. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
Can you fix it? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
I will cancel the fees that you owe. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
You're canceling all the fees? \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
You still need to pay the initial fee. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That'll be fine. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
May I help you? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I have a problem. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What's your problem? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I owe fees, but a bank statement never came in the mail about it. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
I apologize for the inconvenience. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I have no idea about the fee, so my fees went up. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I understand your problem. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Will you be able to solve my problem? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I'm going to cancel the fees you owe. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
So, I don't have to pay any of it? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
The initial fee still must be paid. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That's fabulous. Thank you very much. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I would like to open an account today. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What kind? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I want to open a checking account. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
You need to keep a minimum balance. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
How much is it? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
You need at least $100 in your account. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Is that all? \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Yes. That's the minimum. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What happens if I don't meet that requirement? \Yes_No_Question_[qy]
You will get a fine. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
How much? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
It's going to be $25. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I need to open an account. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Do you know what kind you want to open? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I want a checking account. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Do you know what the minimum balance is? \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
What is that? \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
You need to keep it at $100. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That's it? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That's the least amount you can have. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
What'll happen if I don't maintain that? \Yes_No_Question_[qy]
We will fine you. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
How much will I be fined? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
You will be fined $25. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I want to open an account. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What kind of account do you want to open? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I want to open a checking account. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Do you know the minimum balance you're required to keep? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
How much is that? \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
You have to maintain a minimum balance of $100. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Really? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Yes, really. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What if I can't meet that requirement? \Yes_No_Question_[qy]
You will be fined. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
How much is the fine? \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
It's going to cost you $25. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
How are you doing today? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Very well. Thank you. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What can I help you with? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
Do I have any fees to pay? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
As a matter of fact, you do. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
How much? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
You owe $235.13. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That's unbelievable. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Will you be paying some of that off today? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I want to pay all of it off today. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
How will you be paying? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I'll be paying with cash. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
How are you? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I'm great. Thank you for asking. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What can I do for you? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
Do I owe any fees? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
You sure do. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Could you tell me how much I owe? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
You owe $235.13 in fees. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I can't believe that. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
When will you be paying these fees off? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I'll pay them off right now. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Cash or check? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I will pay with cash. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
How's it going? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I'm great. Thanks. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What do you need? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I need to know if I have any fees to pay. \Yes_No_Question_[qy]
Actually, you do owe some fees. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
How much do I owe? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Your fees total $235.13. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That's crazy! \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
You need to pay these fees soon. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Can I do that right now? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
Will you be paying with cash or check? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I think I'll be paying with cash. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
How may I help you today? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I need to open a second account. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What kind of account would you like to open? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I need another savings account. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Do you have another account with us? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I sure do. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Would you like to transfer money from that account into your new one? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That's fine. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
How much would you like to transfer? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Transfer $100. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Give me a moment while I complete your transaction. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That's fine. Thank you. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
How can I help you? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
I want to open another account. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What kind would you like to open? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I would like to open a savings account. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Do you already have an account with us? \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I have another savings account open already. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Do you want to transfer money from that account? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I would like to do that. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
How much? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I only want to transfer $100. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
It'll only take me a minute to complete your transaction. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Great. Thank you very much. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]

I would like to open another account. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What kind do you want to open? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I want to open a savings account. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Do you have an account opened with this bank already? \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Yes, I do. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
You can always transfer money from that account into your new one. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
That would be great. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
How much money do you want to transfer? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I want to transfer $100. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I'll do that right now. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
All right. Thanks. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
What can I do for you today? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
I have an issue. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What is your problem? \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
There were charges on my debit card that I never made. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Do you have a statement for your debit card? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I do. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Which charges are you talking about? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
It's the last four charges. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
We're going to have to do an investigation. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Is that going to take long? \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
I'm not sure, but in the meantime we will freeze these charges. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That's wonderful. Thank you. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
How may I help you? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I'm having a problem. \Yes_No_Question_[qy]
What problem are you having? \Yes_No_Question_[qy]
There have been charges made on my debit card that I didn't make. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Do you have the statement for your card? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Here it is. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
What are the charges you're referring to? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
The last four charges on the page. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I'm afraid we're going to have to investigate these charges. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
How long will an investigation take? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I honestly don't know, but we will freeze payment on these charges. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That sounds absolutely fantastic. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
May I help you? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I have a problem. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What's the problem? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Someone else is making charges on my debit card. \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
I need to see a statement for your debit card. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I have it right here. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
Can you show me which charges you're referring to? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
The last four charges. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
We will need to do an investigation on this. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
How long will that take? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
We'll have to freeze payment on those charges until the investigation is finished. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
I really appreciate your help. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What can I help you with today? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
When does the library close? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
The library closes at six o'clock. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]

Yes. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]

Absolutely. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]

That's everything. Thanks. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What may I do for you? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I need to get a passport. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
You will need to apply for one. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
When will I be able to do that? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]

Really? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Yes, really. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
How much do I owe? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
You owe $24.50 in late fees. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]

How may I help you? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I couldn't find the book I was looking for. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Have you checked the database? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I checked. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Was it on the shelf? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
It should have been, but it wasn't. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]

Will you be getting another copy anytime soon? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I'm sure we will. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Would you be able to reserve it for me? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]

Thank you very much. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
May I help you? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I can't find the book I want. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Why don't you try looking at the database? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I checked it already. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Do we have it available? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
It wasn't there. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I guess it is lost. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
Will you be getting another copy? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Yes, we will. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Could you reserve a copy for me? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I can do that. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
That's great. Thanks a lot. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What can I do for you? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
I was looking for a book, but I couldn't find it. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
Did you check our database to see if it was on the shelf? \Yes_No_Question_[qy]
I already did. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Is it on the shelf? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
I didn't see it. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Apparently somebody took that book out of the library. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Will you ever get another copy? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]

I need help with something. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What do you need help with? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I am looking for a newspaper article. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Have you looked in the periodicals? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I didn't even think about that. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I can show you where they are. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
That would be a lot of help. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Follow me, please. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]

I am looking for an article in a newspaper. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Did you check the periodicals? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I didn't even bother to think of that. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I'll show you where to find your article. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I get lost in this library. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
It's right this way. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Thanks a lot for your help. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What can I do for you today? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
I need to return a book. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Can I do anything else for you? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
I want to check this magazine out. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
We don't allow people to check out magazines. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Why not? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
It's just a policy of ours. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
So what am I allowed to check out? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
You may check out books or videos. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I need to check out this magazine. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
You will have to just read it in the library. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That doesn't make any sense. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
How may I help you? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I want to return this video. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Is that all you need? \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I also need to check this magazine out. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
You're not allowed to do that. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I don't understand. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
It's our policy. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What can I check out? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
Only books or videos. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I need this magazine. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
You will have to read it here. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That's weird. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
May I help you? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I would like to return this book. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
May I do anything else for you? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I would also like to check out this magazine. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I can't let you do that. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Why is that? \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
Our policy doesn't allow anyone to check out the magazines. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What things am I allowed to check out? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
You are only allowed to check out books or videos. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I really need to check out this magazine. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I'm sorry, but that's our policy. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That's stupid. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What can I do for you today? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
I need to return a book. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Can I do anything else for you? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
I want to check these books out. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Is that all? \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
That's all. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
May I see your library card, please? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
It's right here. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Will that be all for today? \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]

Thanks. Have a good one. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What can I do for you? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
I am trying to find this book. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What's the problem? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
It doesn't seem like this library has it. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Have you checked the computer? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I have already. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What did it say? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
It says the book is on the shelf, but I didn't find it there. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
I can always borrow the book from another library. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
You can do that? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
I'll make the call and contact you when it gets in. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That's fantastic. Thank you. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
May I help you? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I would like to find this book. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Is there a problem? \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
I don't think you guys have it. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
You should look it up on our computer. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I did that. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What came up? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
It should be on the shelf, but I didn't see it. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I can try to get the book from a different library. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
I didn't know you could do that. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I will call you when I find it. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I appreciate your help. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Do you need help with something? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I'm looking for this book. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Is there something wrong? \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
I don't see it on the shelf. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Did you check the computer? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I already looked. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Did it say anything? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
It said that the book is on the shelf, but it isn't. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
I'm sure I can get it from another library. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
Could you do that? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I'll let you know when I get the book in. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That's great. Thank you so much. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
How may I help you? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I need to return these books. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Give them here. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Here they are. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
It appears these books are two weeks late. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I forgot they were due. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
You do realize you are going to have to pay late fees, right? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
How much is the late fee? \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
The late fee is 25 cents a day. \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
So I have to pay 25 cents for each day the books are late? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
It's 25 cents for each book. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That's a lot of money. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
What can I do for you? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
I'm returning these books. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Let me have them. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Here are all of them. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
These books are two weeks late. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I didn't have time to return them. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
You're going to have to pay late fees. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
How much? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
25 cents a day. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
25 cents a day? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That means 25 cents for each late book. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
That's expensive. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
May I help you with something? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I would like to return some books. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
I'll take them. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Here you go. \Statement_opinion_[sv]
These books were due two weeks ago. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
Yeah. I totally forgot they were due. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
You will need to pay late fees on these books. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
How much are the late fees? \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
The fee is 25 cents every day. \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
I have to pay 25 cents a day? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
And that's for each book that is late. \Declarative_Yes_No_Question_[qy^d]
That shouldn't be a problem. \Response_Acknowledgement_[bk]
