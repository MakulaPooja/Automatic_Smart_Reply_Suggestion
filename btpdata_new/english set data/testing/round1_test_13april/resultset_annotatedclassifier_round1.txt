That's not a problem. Leave it with me, and find something that you like. \Statement_opinion_[sv]
I was hoping you'd have something on sale today. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
We have nothing on sale today. But we're having a big sale next weekend. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Is the sale going to include dresses? \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Everything you can see will be on sale. \Response_Acknowledgement_[qy]
I like the sound of that. I'll just come back next weekend. \Statement_opinion_[sv]
The savings will be worth the short wait. See you next weekend. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I'm glad these batteries are on sale. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I'm sorry. These batteries are not on sale. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
But that's what the ad says. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I'm sorry. If you look at the ad again, you'll see that the other brand is on sale. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
You're right. I misread the ad. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Yes, many people make that mistake. \Statement_opinion_[sv]
You can't blame them. It's a confusing ad. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
You're right. Many ads are like that. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
As long as I'm here. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Just one second, and I'll get you the batteries that are on sale. \Yes_answers_[ny]
It's about time these batteries went on sale. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I'm sorry. These aren't on sale today. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
You're kidding me. The ad says they're on sale. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Yes, the other brand of batteries is on sale. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I see. I've got the wrong brand. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Yes, it's an easy mistake to make. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
The ad is written in a misleading way. \Statement_opinion_[sv]
I agree. It seems like all ads are meant to confuse you. \Yes_No_Question_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
It's not the first or last time. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Hold on, and I'll get you the batteries that are on sale. \Yes_answers_[ny]
You don't often find these batteries on sale. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I'm not sure that these batteries are on sale today. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
But the ad says they're on sale. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Yes, batteries are on sale, but not this brand. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
What do you know? I picked up the wrong brand. \Apology_[qw]
Yes, several customers have made that mistake today. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Like many ads, it's deliberately confusing. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I couldn't agree more. They write ads just to get you into the store. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I should know better by now. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
If you can wait one minute, I'll bring you the batteries that are on sale. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
This is the first time I've seen these batteries on sale. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I'm sorry, but they aren't on sale today. \Thanking_[ft]
Look at the ad. The ad says they're on sale. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Yes, the ad says that the other brand of batteries is on sale. \Statement_opinion_[sv]
Yes, I misread the ad. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Believe me, you're not the first person to make that mistake today. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
No wonder people make a mistake. The price is in big letters, and the brand is in tiny letters. \Yes_No_Question_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
You're right. You have to read an ad two or three times sometimes. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
You have to be careful with every ad you read. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
It's okay. I'll go get you the batteries that are on sale. \Response_Acknowledgement_[qy]
These batteries should be on sale more often. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I don't think these batteries are on sale. \Statement_opinion_[sv]
Look at the ad. It says they're on sale. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
You're right. Batteries are on sale, but not this brand of batteries. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I didn't pay attention to the brand name. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Several people have misread that ad already today. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
People make the mistake because the ad is misleading. \Statement_opinion_[sv]
I agree with you. Ads can be very tricky. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I don't know when I'll ever learn. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
No problem. I'll bring you the batteries that are on sale. I'll be right back. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Excuse me, but is this dress on sale? \Response_Acknowledgement_[qy]
The dress was on sale yesterday. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Are you sure? I'd be happy to pay the sale price today. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I'm so sorry, but rules are rules. \Thanking_[ft]
I'll just check out a few other stores. \Yes_No_Question_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
I'm sorry I couldn't help you. \Statement_opinion_[sv]
Pardon me. Is this dress on sale? \Response_Acknowledgement_[qy]
Actually, the sale ended yesterday. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
You know, it's only one day later. How about giving me the sale price? \Apology_[qw]
I'm sorry, but I can't change the price that's in the computer. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Let me think about it. Maybe I'll wait until the next sale. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Take a look around. Maybe you'll see something else you like. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Is this dress on sale? \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
It was on sale—yesterday. \Action_derective_[ad]
Still, couldn't you sell it to me today at the sale price? \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I'm sorry, but I'd lose my job if I sold it to you at yesterday's sale price. \Response_Acknowledgement_[qy]
I had my heart set on buying this dress. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Well, feel free to browse. We have other items on sale today. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Am I right in thinking that this dress is on sale? \Statement_opinion_[sv]
I'm sorry. You're one day too late for the sale. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Couldn't you still sell it today at the sale price? \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I'm sorry. One day can make a big difference sometimes. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
No problem. Other stores are having sales. I'll check them out. \Yes_No_Question_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
Before you go, let me show you some other dresses that are on sale. \Response_Acknowledgement_[qy]
Am I mistaken, or is this dress on sale? \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I'm very sorry. The sale ended yesterday. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I really like this dress, but I want to pay the sale price. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
If you like, I can put you on our mailing list for the next sale. \Response_Acknowledgement_[qy]
That's okay. Some days you win, some days you lose. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Let me ask my manager when he thinks this dress will be on sale again. \Response_Acknowledgement_[qy]
I am looking for a pan. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
No problem. What size would you like? \Apology_[qw]
A big one would be nice. \Statement_opinion_[sv]
How about this one? It's our biggest—16" in diameter. \Yes_No_Question_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
I like that one, but it's too heavy. \Statement_opinion_[sv]
Okay, try this one. It's made of aluminum. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
This is much better. But it has an aluminum handle. \Apology_[qw]
Here you go. Same pan, but with a state-of-the-art, heat-resistant plastic handle. \Yes_No_Question_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
That's perfect. I'll take it. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Great. Will that be cash or charge? \Apology_[qw]
Wait a minute. What about a lid for the pan? \Apology_[qw]
I'm sorry. I forgot to show you the lid. It comes with the pan. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I need a pan. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Okay. Do you have a particular size in mind? \Response_Acknowledgement_[qy]
The bigger the better, I think. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Look at this one. It's our biggest pan. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
That is big enough, but it's too heavy for me. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Okay, we have the same thing in aluminum. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
This is nice and light. But it has an aluminum handle. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Try this one. Same aluminum pan, but with a heat-resistant bamboo handle. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
This is very nice. I'll take this one. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
That's a good choice. How do you want to pay for it? \Response_Acknowledgement_[qy]
Cash. Oh, I almost forgot. I need a lid, too. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I'm so sorry. A lid comes with the pan. Here it is. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I'd like to purchase a pan. \Statement_opinion_[sv]
Is there any particular size that you want? \Response_Acknowledgement_[qy]
I cook a lot of big meals. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
What do you think of this one? It's a 16" pan. \Apology_[qw]
That's the right size, but it's so heavy. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Well, look at our aluminum pan. It's much lighter. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Yes, this is very light, but the handle is also aluminum. \Statement_opinion_[sv]
No problem. Look at this one. Same pan, but with a lightweight wooden handle. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Great. This is exactly what I was looking for. I'll buy it. \Apology_[qw]
I think you'll love this pan. Do you want to pay with cash? \Response_Acknowledgement_[qy]
Yes. Oh, wait a second, please. What about a lid? \Yes_answers_[ny]
I'm sorry. I forgot to show it to you. Here it is. It comes with the pan. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Can you help me find a pan? \Response_Acknowledgement_[qy]
Are you looking for a small, medium, or large pan? \Response_Acknowledgement_[qy]
I want a big pan. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Does this one look big enough? \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
It's the right size, but it weighs too much. \Statement_opinion_[sv]
Well, what do you think of the aluminum pan? \Apology_[qw]
It's light enough, but the handle will get too hot after cooking. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Here's the same pan, but it has a space-age, heat-resistant plastic handle. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
My family's going to love this one. I'll take it. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I'm so happy that you found what you wanted. Do you want to use a credit card? \Apology_[qw]
Sure. Wait, wait. Does a lid come with this pan? \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Oh, I'm sorry. Here's the lid. Yes, it comes with the pan. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I'm looking for a pan I can use in my kitchen. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
What size pan were you thinking of? \Apology_[qw]
I've already got a small pan. I need a big one. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Well, this one might work for you. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
No, that's way too heavy a pan for me. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Here, lift this aluminum pan. It's the same size. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Yes, it's very lightweight. But I don't want this aluminum handle. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Here's a similar aluminum pan. But it has a heat-resistant handle. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
This feels very nice. It's perfect. I'll take it. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I knew we'd find the right pan sooner or later. How would you like to pay? \Apology_[qw]
Cash. But first, I need a lid for this pan. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Oh, no problem. Here's the lid that comes with the pan. \Statement_opinion_[sv]
I want to find an old music box. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
We have a great selection. What decade are you looking for? \Apology_[qw]
Do you have anything made in the 1920s? \Response_Acknowledgement_[qy]
We have six. \Other_[bk]
Do any of them have dancing figures? \Response_Acknowledgement_[qy]
Actually, two of them have dancing figures. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
That's fantastic. I think I like this one. \Statement_opinion_[sv]
A good choice. I prefer that one myself. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Is there any warranty with this? \Response_Acknowledgement_[qy]
Oh, no, I'm afraid not. These things are just too old to guarantee anything. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I understand. \Yes_answers_[ny]
Even if they break down, they're still works of art. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Excuse me. I'm looking for an old music box. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Any particular decade? \Response_Acknowledgement_[qy]
Something made in the 20s would be nice. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
We had seven, but we sold one this morning. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Are dancing figures a part of any of the boxes? \Response_Acknowledgement_[qy]
You're in luck. Two of them have dancing figures. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
These are great. I think I'll take this one. \Statement_opinion_[sv]
Yes, that one is very nice. \Response_Acknowledgement_[qy]
Does this come with a warranty? \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I'm sorry, but you just have to take your chances. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
That doesn't surprise me. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Even if it doesn't work, it's a beautiful collectible. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Pardon me. I need an old music box. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Exactly how old a box do you want? \Apology_[qw]
Actually, I was thinking about something from the 1920s. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
We still have six left. \Other_[bk]
Do any of the boxes have dancing figures? \Response_Acknowledgement_[qy]
Dancing figures are quite popular. Two of the boxes have them. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I love the dancing figures. I'll take this music box. \Apology_[qw]
Yes, I think you'll be very satisfied with that one. \Statement_opinion_[sv]
I was wondering, does this come with any kind of warranty? \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
No. But if something goes wrong with it, I know someone who repairs these things. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I was just hoping. \Apology_[qw]
It's amazing that these things still work as well as they do. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I want to purchase an old music box. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
We have a good variety. What decade would you like? \Apology_[qw]
I was hoping I could find something made in the 20s. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
There are six on this table. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I hope at least one of them has dancing figures. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Many people like the dancing figures. Two of our boxes have the figures. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
It's so hard to choose. I think I'll take this one. \Statement_opinion_[sv]
That one will bring you many hours of pleasure. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Does a warranty come with this music box? \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I'm sorry, but if it breaks down, you're on your own. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I just thought I would ask. \Statement_opinion_[sv]
When you buy a Model T, you can't expect a warranty. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I'm searching for an old music box. \Statement_opinion_[sv]
You came to the right place. Any particular decade? \Response_Acknowledgement_[qy]
If you had a box made in the 20s, that would be nice. \Statement_opinion_[sv]
We just got one in yesterday, so now we have six. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Would any of them have dancing figures? \Response_Acknowledgement_[qy]
Yes, we still have two boxes left that have dancing figures. \Other_[bk]
They're both so beautiful. Let me have this one, I think. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
That one truly is a beautiful piece of work, isn't it? \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
One last question: Do you provide a warranty with the box? \Response_Acknowledgement_[qy]
Oh, no. Everything we sell here is ‘as is.' \Yes_No_Question_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
I guess I was asking for too much. \Apology_[qw]
If it breaks down, maybe you can find a repairman on the Internet. \Response_Acknowledgement_[qy]
I need some flowers for my wife. It's her birthday. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Very well. We have some fresh red roses. \Other_[bk]
How much are the roses? \Apology_[qw]
$20 per dozen. \Other_[bk]
That sounds like a good deal. \Statement_opinion_[sv]
Yes, they're on sale today. \Yes_answers_[ny]
I'll take a dozen. \Action_derective_[ad]
Splendid. Will there be anything else? \Yes_answers_[ny]
No, the roses will be fine. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I'm sure your wife will love them. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
My wife's birthday is today. I need some flowers. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
We have lots of fresh red roses. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
How much do the roses cost? \Apology_[qw]
$20 a dozen. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
That sounds good. Last year I paid $30. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Yes, you came here on the right day. They're on sale today. \Response_Acknowledgement_[qy]
Give me a dozen. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Very good. Would you like anything else? \Response_Acknowledgement_[qy]
No, I'll just give her the roses and a card. \Action_derective_[ad]
She should be very pleased with these roses. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I need to buy some flowers for my wife. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Perhaps you'd be interested in red roses. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
What would the roses cost me? \Apology_[qw]
They're only $20 a dozen. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I like the sound of that. \Statement_opinion_[sv]
Yes, that is today's sale price. \Response_Acknowledgement_[qy]
A dozen will be fine. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Is there anything else you'd like to get? \Response_Acknowledgement_[qy]
No, thank you. \Wh_question_[fa]
These roses should make your wife very happy. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
I want to buy some flowers for my wife's birthday. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Red roses are always a popular gift for birthdays. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
What are the roses going for? \Apology_[qw]
They're only $20 a dozen. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
That sounds nice and cheap. \Statement_opinion_[sv]
Yes, you're saving money because they're on sale today. \Statement_opinion_[sv]
Give me the roses. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Could I interest you in anything else? \Response_Acknowledgement_[qy]
No, but thanks anyway. \Wh_question_[fa]
Your wife will be thrilled with the roses. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
It's my wife's birthday. I need to buy some flowers for her. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Most women love red roses for their birthday. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
How much will the roses be? \Apology_[qw]
You can get a dozen for only $20. \Response_Acknowledgement_[qy]
Now, that's a price that I like. \Statement_opinion_[sv]
You're in luck today because the roses are on sale. \Response_Acknowledgement_[qy]
I'll take the roses. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
Very good. Perhaps you'd like something else to go with the roses? \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
No, the roses are good enough. \Response_Acknowledgement_[qy]
Women love roses, so your wife will be very happy. \Statement_non_opinion_[sd]
