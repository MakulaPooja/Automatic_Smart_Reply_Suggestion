I'm glad these batteries are on sale.
 I'm sorry. These batteries are not on sale.
 But that's what the ad says.
 I'm sorry. If you look at the ad again, you'll see that the other brand is on sale.
 You're right. I misread the ad.
 Yes, many people make that mistake.
 You can't blame them. It's a confusing ad.
 You're right. Many ads are like that.
 As long as I'm here.
 Just one second, and I'll get you the batteries that are on sale.
It's about time these batteries went on sale.
 I'm sorry. These aren't on sale today.
 You're kidding me. The ad says they're on sale.
 Yes, the other brand of batteries is on sale.
 I see. I've got the wrong brand.
 Yes, it's an easy mistake to make.
 The ad is written in a misleading way.
 I agree. It seems like all ads are meant to confuse you.
 It's not the first or last time.
 Hold on, and I'll get you the batteries that are on sale.
You don't often find these batteries on sale.
 I'm not sure that these batteries are on sale today.
 But the ad says they're on sale.
 Yes, batteries are on sale, but not this brand.
 What do you know? I picked up the wrong brand.
 Yes, several customers have made that mistake today.
 Like many ads, it's deliberately confusing.
 I couldn't agree more. They write ads just to get you into the store.
 I should know better by now.
 If you can wait one minute, I'll bring you the batteries that are on sale.
This is the first time I've seen these batteries on sale.
 I'm sorry, but they aren't on sale today.
 Look at the ad. The ad says they're on sale.
 Yes, the ad says that the other brand of batteries is on sale.
 Yes, I misread the ad.
 Believe me, you're not the first person to make that mistake today.
 No wonder people make a mistake. The price is in big letters, and the brand is in tiny letters.
 You're right. You have to read an ad two or three times sometimes.
 You have to be careful with every ad you read.
 It's okay. I'll go get you the batteries that are on sale.
These batteries should be on sale more often.
 I don't think these batteries are on sale.
 Look at the ad. It says they're on sale.
 You're right. Batteries are on sale, but not this brand of batteries.
 I didn't pay attention to the brand name.
 Several people have misread that ad already today.
 People make the mistake because the ad is misleading.
 I agree with you. Ads can be very tricky.
 I don't know when I'll ever learn.
 No problem. I'll bring you the batteries that are on sale. I'll be right back.
Excuse me, but is this dress on sale?
 The dress was on sale yesterday.
 Are you sure? I'd be happy to pay the sale price today.
 I'm so sorry, but rules are rules.
 I'll just check out a few other stores.
 I'm sorry I couldn't help you.
Pardon me. Is this dress on sale?
 Actually, the sale ended yesterday.
 You know, it's only one day later. How about giving me the sale price?
 I'm sorry, but I can't change the price that's in the computer.
 Let me think about it. Maybe I'll wait until the next sale.
 Take a look around. Maybe you'll see something else you like.
Is this dress on sale?
 It was on sale—yesterday.
 Still, couldn't you sell it to me today at the sale price?
 I'm sorry, but I'd lose my job if I sold it to you at yesterday's sale price.
 I had my heart set on buying this dress.
 Well, feel free to browse. We have other items on sale today.
Am I right in thinking that this dress is on sale?
 I'm sorry. You're one day too late for the sale.
 Couldn't you still sell it today at the sale price?

 Let me ask my manager when he thinks this dress will be on sale again.
I am looking for a pan.
 No problem. What size would you like?
 A big one would be nice.
 How about this one? It's our biggest—16" in diameter.
 I like that one, but it's too heavy.
 Okay, try this one. It's made of aluminum.
 This is much better. But it has an aluminum handle.
 Here you go. Same pan, but with a state-of-the-art, heat-resistant plastic handle.
 That's perfect. I'll take it.
 Great. Will that be cash or charge?
 Wait a minute. What about a lid for the pan?
 I'm sorry. I forgot to show you the lid. It comes with the pan.
I need a pan.
 Okay. Do you have a particular size in mind?
 The bigger the better, I think.
 Look at this one. It's our biggest pan.
 That is big enough, but it's too heavy for me.
 Okay, we have the same thing in aluminum.
 This is nice and light. But it has an aluminum handle.
 Try this one. Same aluminum pan, but with a heat-resistant bamboo handle.
 This is very nice. I'll take this one.
 That's a good choice. How do you want to pay for it?
 Cash. Oh, I almost forgot. I need a lid, too.
 I'm so sorry. A lid comes with the pan. Here it is.
I'd like to purchase a pan.
 Is there any particular size that you want?
 I cook a lot of big meals.
 What do you think of this one? It's a 16" pan.
 That's the right size, but it's so heavy.
 Well, look at our aluminum pan. It's much lighter.
 Yes, this is very light, but the handle is also aluminum.
 No problem. Look at this one. Same pan, but with a lightweight wooden handle.
 Great. This is exactly what I was looking for. I'll buy it.
 I think you'll love this pan. Do you want to pay with cash?
 Yes. Oh, wait a second, please. What about a lid?
 I'm sorry. I forgot to show it to you. Here it is. It comes with the pan.
Can you help me find a pan?
 Are you looking for a small, medium, or large pan?
 I want a big pan.
 Does this one look big enough?
 It's the right size, but it weighs too much.
 Well, what do you think of the aluminum pan?
 It's light enough, but the handle will get too hot after cooking.
 Here's the same pan, but it has a space-age, heat-resistant plastic handle.
 My family's going to love this one. I'll take it.
 I'm so happy that you found what you wanted. Do you want to use a credit card?
 Sure. Wait, wait. Does a lid come with this pan?
 Oh, I'm sorry. Here's the lid. Yes, it comes with the pan.
I'm looking for a pan I can use in my kitchen.
 What size pan were you thinking of?
 I've already got a small pan. I need a big one.
 Well, this one might work for you.
 No, that's way too heavy a pan for me.
 Here, lift this aluminum pan. It's the same size.
 Yes, it's very lightweight. But I don't want this aluminum handle.
 Here's a similar aluminum pan. But it has a heat-resistant handle.
 This feels very nice. It's perfect. I'll take it.
 I knew we'd find the right pan sooner or later. How would you like to pay?
 Cash. But first, I need a lid for this pan.
 Oh, no problem. Here's the lid that comes with the pan.
I want to find an old music box.
 We have a great selection. What decade are you looking for?
 Do you have anything made in the 1920s?
 We have six.
 Do any of them have dancing figures?
 Actually, two of them have dancing figures.
 That's fantastic. I think I like this one.
 A good choice. I prefer that one myself.
 Is there any warranty with this?
 Oh, no, I'm afraid not. These things are just too old to guarantee anything.
 I understand.
 Even if they break down, they're still works of art.
Excuse me. I'm looking for an old music box.
 Any particular decade?
 Something made in the 20s would be nice.
 We had seven, but we sold one this morning.
 Are dancing figures a part of any of the boxes?
 You're in luck. Two of them have dancing figures.
 These are great. I think I'll take this one.
 Yes, that one is very nice.
 Does this come with a warranty?
 I'm sorry, but you just have to take your chances.
 That doesn't surprise me.
 Even if it doesn't work, it's a beautiful collectible.
Pardon me. I need an old music box.
 Exactly how old a box do you want?
 Actually, I was thinking about something from the 1920s.
 We still have six left.
 Do any of the boxes have dancing figures?
 Dancing figures are quite popular. Two of the boxes have them.
 I love the dancing figures. I'll take this music box.
 Yes, I think you'll be very satisfied with that one.
 I was wondering, does this come with any kind of warranty?
 No. But if something goes wrong with it, I know someone who repairs these things.
 I was just hoping.
 It's amazing that these things still work as well as they do.
I want to purchase an old music box.
 We have a good variety. What decade would you like?
 I was hoping I could find something made in the 20s.
 There are six on this table.
 I hope at least one of them has dancing figures.
 Many people like the dancing figures. Two of our boxes have the figures.
 It's so hard to choose. I think I'll take this one.
 That one will bring you many hours of pleasure.
 Does a warranty come with this music box?
 I'm sorry, but if it breaks down, you're on your own.
 I just thought I would ask.
 When you buy a Model T, you can't expect a warranty.
I'm searching for an old music box.
 You came to the right place. Any particular decade?
 If you had a box made in the 20s, that would be nice.
 We just got one in yesterday, so now we have six.
 Would any of them have dancing figures?
 Yes, we still have two boxes left that have dancing figures.
 They're both so beautiful. Let me have this one, I think.
 That one truly is a beautiful piece of work, isn't it?
 One last question: Do you provide a warranty with the box?
 Oh, no. Everything we sell here is ‘as is.'
 I guess I was asking for too much.
 If it breaks down, maybe you can find a repairman on the Internet.
