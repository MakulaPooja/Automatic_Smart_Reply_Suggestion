In fact I did do well enough to shove it in their face, never had a single backlog through out with a distinction, got placed in an MNC,got an admission from a graduate school and a ticket to US. \Statement_opinion_[sv]
But in retrospect , I regret for having behaved the way I did in my B.Tech.Even though as it may appear that I may have proved people wrong, the journey towards success begins now i.e after graduation and nothing else. \Statement_opinion_[sv]
So, you never know. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]

But everyone I hang out with likes being in a big group whenever they do things and always have to be entertained. \Statement_opinion_[sv]

 Thank you very much. \Thanking_[ft]

 Thank you so much. \Thanking_[ft]
 Will you be needing anything else? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 That's it for today. \Response Acknowledgement_[bk]
 How's it going? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 I'm fine. Thanks for asking. \Statement-opinion_[sv]

 I want it taken from my checking account. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 All right, here is your $300. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Thanks a lot. \Thanking_[ft]
 Is there anything else that I can do for you today? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 No. That's everything. Thank you. \Thanking_[ft]
 I need help with the office party. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Yes, of course. We could split it. What part would you like to do, the food or the entertainment? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 I have no idea what the entertainment should be. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
 Let's make sure we are on the same page. Do we want a formal or informal gathering? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 Let's make it a formal affair. \Action-directive_[ad]
 Yes, that would be best. Now, for food should we have Chinese or American food? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 American food would be the best choice. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 That would be great. What kind of music would you like, a band or recorded music? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 We should bring in a really good DJ. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 That works for me. Let's see what we can each do about planning our part and meet again on Friday. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
 Would you help me figure out what to do about the office party? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 I would be happy to help. What would you like me to help with, food or entertainment? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 I would like to help you with both. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 That will work out fine. To make sure everything goes together, do you think this party should be casual or dressy? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 A dressy party would be fun! \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 That will work out fine. Do you think that Chinese or Continental food would be best? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 We should probably have both. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Yes, that will work out fine. Should we hire a band or bring in a DJ? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 Maybe we could do both! \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Everything sounds great then! I'll meet you back here on Friday to discuss the details. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I was wondering if you need any help on your new project. \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 Sure! That would be great! Are you good at writing or would you rather do the computer work? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 I would like to help with the computer work. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Great! We are going to be working in teams of three. Are you OK working with others? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 Yes, I like working like that. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 We will begin next Monday. Would you be available then? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 Yes, I can be there. \Response Acknowledgement_[bk]
 Well, if you could send me your basic background information before next Monday, it would be useful. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I will send the information to you. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Well then, thanks for your help. Have a great day! \Thanking_[ft]
 Would you like me to help you on your new project? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 I would love the help! Would you prefer helping with the writing part or is programming more your thing? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 I would enjoy helping with the writing portion. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Perfect! You'll be working alone on that portion. Do you like to work alone? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 That is OK sometimes. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Our first meeting is next Monday. Could you meet with us at that time? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 No, I can't be there. \Response Acknowledgement_[bk]
 Please send me your background information before the meeting so I can look at it. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I can send that information to you. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 OK. I look forward to working with you. Enjoy your week! \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Could I help you on your new project? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 I have a need for help with writing and also a need for help with the computer work. Which would you prefer? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 I want to help with both. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 That would be wonderful. Sometimes we will be working together and sometimes independently. Would that be OK? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 Most of the time that is what I prefer. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 We start on Monday. Can you be there? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 I am not sure yet. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I need your background information before the meeting. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I will do that. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I'll enjoy working with you. Have a great day! \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I need help preparing for my presentation on Friday. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I could help you with that. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Are you sure you have the time? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 I promise you that I have the time to do this. If I didn't, I wouldn't offer to help. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 What would be the best time for you to help me? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 Tomorrow night would work for me. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Should we just meet here? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 OK, and I'll bring some information that helped me with my presentation. \Response Acknowledgement_[bk]
 I'll see you then. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 See you tomorrow night. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Could you help me prepare for my presentation on Friday? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 I would love to help you prepare for your presentation. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 I hate to ask you to do something like that. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 This will not interfere with my work. I promise you that. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 When could we get together? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 I could easily give you some time tomorrow night. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Would you like to meet at the coffee house next door? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 Yes, and could you write down anything you might be having trouble with? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 I'll come prepared. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Goodbye until then. I promise you that you'll do well after we meet. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I am a little nervous about my presentation on Friday. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 If you would like me to, I could help you with that. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Wouldn't that take you away from your project? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 I have plenty of time to do this. I promise you it won't be a problem for me. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Is there a good time for you to help me? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 If we work on this tomorrow night, you could easily be ready for Friday. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 How about meeting in my office? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 That would work out well. Bring any concerns that you might have. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Sounds like you'll be able to help me a lot. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Don't worry. Everything will go well. I promise! \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Whoa, look at all those ice cream choices! \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Yes, that is a lot of choices. What is your favorite? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 I love anything with chocolate the best. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 I like chocolate myself. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Is there any kind of ice cream you don't like? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 I really don't like any ice cream with nuts in it. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 I haven't ever cared for that myself. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Have you ever had garlic ice cream? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 That sounds absolutely disgusting! \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 It was. Let's stick with the regular choices today, though. \Action-directive_[ad]
 How are you doing today? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 I'm fine. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 What can I do for you? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 I would like to cancel a check. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Is there a problem? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 I wrote the check out for too much. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 How much did you write it out for? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 I wrote it out for $150. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 How much was it supposed to be? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 It was supposed to be for $100. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I'll cancel that check for you. \Action-directive_[ad]
 I really appreciate your help. \Appreciation_[ba]
 How are you? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 I'm doing well. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 How may I help you? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 Could you cancel a check for me? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 What's the problem? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 I wrote the check out for way too much. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 How much? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 I wrote the check out for $150. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 What were you supposed to write it out for? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 I was supposed to write the check out for $100. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I'll just cancel it for you right now. \Action-directive_[ad]
 That's great. You're a lifesaver. \Thanking_[ft]
 How's it going? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 Great. Thank you. \Thanking_[ft]
 What can I help you with? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 I need to cancel a check. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 What's wrong with the check? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 I accidentally wrote the check for too much. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 How much did you write the check for? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 The check was written for $150. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 How much were you supposed to write it for? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 I needed to write it for $100. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I can cancel it for you right now. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Thank you so much. \Thanking_[ft]
 What can I help you with today? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 I would like to make a deposit. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Will that be cash or check? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 I'm depositing a check. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Could you sign the back of the check, please? \Action-directive_[ad]
 All right. Here you go. \Yes answers_[ny]
 Would you like any cash back? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 That would be great. \Yes answers_[ny]
 How much would you like? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 I would like $150. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Here is your $150. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Thanks for everything. \Thanking_[ft]
 How may I help you? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 I'm making a deposit today. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Cash or check? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
 I would like to deposit a check. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 You need to sign the back. \Action-directive_[ad]
 Okay. Here you go. \Response Acknowledgement_[bk]
 Would you like cash back? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 Yes, I would. \Yes answers_[ny]
 How much? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 Let me get $150 back. \Action-directive_[ad]
 Here you go. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
 Thank you. Have a good one. \Thanking_[ft]
 What can I do for you? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 I need to make a deposit. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Are you depositing cash or a check? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 I'm depositing a check. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Please sign the back of the check. \Action-directive_[ad]
 There you go. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
 Do you want cash back? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 Yes, please. \Yes answers_[ny]
 How much cash would you like? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 I want $150. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Here is your $150. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
 Thank you, and have a nice day. \Thanking_[ft]
 Can I help you with something? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 I need to cancel one of my accounts. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Is there a problem with it? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 I don't need it anymore. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 What would you like to do with all the money in this account? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 Just transfer it over to my remaining account. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I can do that. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 That would be great. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Do you want to take any money out? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 Not today. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
 It's going to take a moment for me to cancel your account. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 That's fine. Take your time. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 What can I do for you? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 I would like to cancel one of my accounts. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Is there a problem with your account? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 I only need one. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 What about all your money in that account? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 Could you please transfer that money to my remaining account? \Action-directive_[ad]
 That's fine. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I appreciate it. \Appreciation_[ba]
 Would you like to make a withdrawal? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 That's all for today. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I'll just cancel your account right now. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I greatly appreciate your help. \Appreciation_[ba]

 I need to cancel an account. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Do you have a problem with your account? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 I don't need two different accounts anymore. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 What are you going to do about the money in your account? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 Can I transfer it to my remaining account? \Action-directive_[ad]
 I'll do that for you. \Yes answers_[ny]
 That's lovely. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Would you like to withdraw any money? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 No. That's fine. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
 It'll just take me a moment to cancel your account. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Thank you very much. \Thanking_[ft]
 Do you have any other questions? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 I want to know about fees. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Which fees? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 Overdraft fees. \Response Acknowledgement_[bk]
 You will be required to pay a small fee for every time you overdraft. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 How much is the fee? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 You'll have to pay $25 every time you overdraft. \Action-directive_[ad]
 That's a small fee? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
 It should stop you from overdrafting. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 You would think it would, but it most likely won't. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
 Can I help you with anything else? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 That's it for today. Thank you. \Thanking_[ft]
 Do you have any questions? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 Tell me about fees. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 What fees are you referring to? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 I want to know about overdraft fees. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 We charge a small fee every time you overdraft. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 How much? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 For each time you overdraft, you have to pay $25. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 That's not a small fee. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 You shouldn't overdraft. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 That's for sure. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Do you need help with anything else? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 That's all I needed to know. Thanks. \Thanking_[ft]
 Would you like to ask any questions? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 I need to know about the fees. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 What kind of fees? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 I'm asking about overdraft fees. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 You have to pay a small fee every time you overdraft. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 What's the fee? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 The fee is $25 every time you overdraft. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 How is that a small fee? \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 That fee should keep you from overdrafting. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I'll say. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
 Do you have any more questions? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 I don't need to know anything else. Thank you. \Thanking_[ft]
 There are so many flavors of ice cream to choose from! \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
 Yes, there must be about a hundred. Do you have a favorite? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 I love fruit flavored ices the best. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Yes, fresh fruit flavored is the best ever. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 What is your least favorite ice cream? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 I don't like peppermint ice cream. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Yes, I know what you mean. \Yes answers_[ny]
 One time, I tried garlic ice cream. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 That could be interesting. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 That doesn't sound like a good choice for today. Let's order! \Action-directive_[ad]
 I have never seen so many flavors of ice cream in one place! \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 There certainly are a lot. Can you choose a favorite? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 Vanilla with toppings is my favorite. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Is there anything as good as a hot fudge sundae? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 No way! \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
 I don't like ice cream with too many different flavors in it. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 I agree with that, it just doesn't work for me. \Yes answers_[ny]
 I saw garlic ice cream on the menu once. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I think that that would be horrible! \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 I think I'll stick with a more traditional choice today! \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
 I was thinking about applying for the new position. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Do you think that is a good idea? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 It seems like a good idea but I am not really sure. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 What are your main concerns? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 It would give me a chance to grow, but I am wondering if I would like the job. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 I know what you mean, I've thought about that myself. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 I also am thinking about the pay. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Could you take a slight pay decrease for a chance to move forward? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 Yes, it might be worth it. I am not certain. \Yes answers_[ny]
 I think I'm convinced that trying for this position is the best choice for you. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 I am not certain, but I think I might ask to be considered for the new job. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Why are you considering trying for it? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 I think that I might like it, but I am still thinking about it. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 What is it about this job that appeals to you? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 I think that I would enjoy the position but there isn't a lot of creativity involved. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Yes, you could be right. There is a lot to consider. \Yes answers_[ny]
 I am also wondering about the pay. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Would a slight decrease in pay be worth it for a new opportunity for growth? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 I am thinking that might be the case. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 I think you should give it a shot. What do you have to lose? You can always change your mind. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 I am considering going for the new job that was posted yesterday. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Are you certain that that is what you want to do. \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 It may not be the best choice for me, but I am considering it. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Why do you think that this would be a good move? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 I believe that this job would allow me to move up but might be a little boring for me. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Yes, there are always pros and cons to making a career change. \Yes answers_[ny]
 Also, the matter of pay is also a consideration. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I think the slight pay decrease might be worth it. The benefits are much better. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Yes, sometimes giving up a little to move forward is the best choice. \Yes answers_[ny]
 I think you definitely should apply for the position. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 I was thinking of holding the company retreat in the mountains. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I agree, I think that that would be perfect! \Yes answers_[ny]
 I was thinking it could take place sometime in January. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 That might be a little too cold for some people. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Yes, you are right. \Yes answers_[ny]
 What about April? April has good weather that isn't too cold or too hot. \Wh-Question_[qw]
 Yes, that would work out better. \Yes answers_[ny]
 You know, maybe we could take a survey to see how that works for everyone. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Good idea! We'll have to get right on it. \Yes answers_[ny]
 Fine! Well, I'll get right on it now! \Yes answers_[ny]
 I think that the company retreat should be in the mountains this year. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 What a great idea! \Yes answers_[ny]
 January would be a good month for a mountain retreat. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 I like the mountain idea, but I am not so sure about the month of January. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 You know, now that I think about it, you might be right. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 April might be nice. It is far enough away to make the necessary arrangements. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 That is a good suggestion. \Yes answers_[ny]
 We could ask everyone what would be the best time for them. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Yes, that would let us know what would work best. \Yes answers_[ny]
 I'll put the survey online this afternoon. \Action-directive_[ad]
 The Mountains would be a great place for the company retreat. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 That's a wonderful choice. \Yes answers_[ny]
 I have chosen January as the month for this retreat. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 January is a little too close to the Christmas holidays.  \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Yes, maybe another choice might be better. \Yes answers_[ny]
 I think that April would work. Spring is a lovely time to be in the mountains. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Thank you for thinking of that. \Thanking_[ft]
 Maybe if we asked around we could see what people would prefer. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 That is a good idea. \Yes answers_[ny]
 I'll take care of taking the survey and get back to you with the answers. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I was wondering if I could borrow the company van for a fundraiser this weekend. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Sure, I think that would be possible. Where is the fundraiser? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 It is in the park downtown. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Would you need it for both Saturday and Sunday? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 We will need it for Saturday only. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I think that would be OK. Who will be driving it? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 Mary and I will be driving the van. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Could you drop it off on Sunday night? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 Yes, we can do that. Can we borrow the chairs from the lunchroom also? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 Yes, that would be fine. Just make sure that everything is returned by Sunday night. \Yes answers_[ny]
 Our unit is participating in a fundraiser this weekend and would like to borrow the van, if possible. \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 I would need to check on that. Where is the fundraiser? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 It will be at the beach by the pier. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 What day will you need it for? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 We will only be needing it for Sunday. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Maybe that could work. I need to know who will be driving it. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 The only two drivers will be Mary and I. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 If I give you the keys to the garage, could you bring it back on Sunday evening? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 Sure. We also would like to use the chairs from the lunchroom. Would that be OK? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 OK, but make sure that everything is back by Sunday night at the latest. \Yes answers_[ny]
 Could we borrow the company van for a fundraiser this weekend? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 That would be a possibility. Where is this fundraiser taking place? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 It is in the hotel ballroom down the street. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Do you need it for the whole weekend? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 We will need it for both days. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 We will need to know who will be driving the van. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 The van will be driven by Mary and me. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 It needs to be back on Sunday night. Can you arrange for that? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 Yes, no problem. Would you mind if we borrowed a few of the chairs from the lunchroom? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 Just keep track of everything and get it all back where you took it from by Sunday evening. \Yes answers_[ny]
 Your total comes to $36.78. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Put it on my VISA. \Action-directive_[ad]
 There's a problem with your card. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 What's wrong with it? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 I believe it was declined. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 You're kidding me! \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
 Do you have another card I could try? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 I only have one card. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Do you have cash, perhaps? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 I don't have any cash on me. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 You're not going to be able to take these items today. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I'll be back tomorrow. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 The total for all these items comes to $36.78. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
 Take my VISA. \Action-directive_[ad]
 There is something wrong with your card. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 What's going on? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 Your card was declined. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 That can't be right! \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Would you like me to try another card? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 I don't have another one. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 What about cash? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 I didn't bring cash with me today. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I'm sorry, but you can't take the items until you can buy them. \Apology_[fa]
 I'll come back for them tomorrow. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 You owe $36.78. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Here's my VISA card. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
 I'm sorry, but your card isn't working. \Apology_[fa]
 What's the problem? \Wh-Question_[qw]

 What things am I allowed to check out? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 You are only allowed to check out books or videos. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]

 What can I do for you? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 I am trying to find this book. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 What's the problem? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 It doesn't seem like this library has it. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Have you checked the computer? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 I have already. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 What did it say? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 It says the book is on the shelf, but I didn't find it there. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I can always borrow the book from another library. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 You can do that? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 I'll make the call and contact you when it gets in. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 That's fantastic. Thank you. \Thanking_[ft]
 May I help you? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 I would like to find this book. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Is there a problem? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 I don't think you guys have it. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 You should look it up on our computer. \Action-directive_[ad]
 I did that. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 What came up? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 It should be on the shelf, but I didn't see it. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I can try to get the book from a different library. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I didn't know you could do that. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I will call you when I find it. \Action-directive_[ad]
 I appreciate your help. \Appreciation_[ba]
 Do you need help with something? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 I'm looking for this book. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Is there something wrong? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 I don't see it on the shelf. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Did you check the computer? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 I already looked. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Did it say anything? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 It said that the book is on the shelf, but it isn't. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I'm sure I can get it from another library. \Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Could you do that? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 I'll let you know when I get the book in. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 That's great. Thank you so much. \Thanking_[ft]
 How may I help you? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 I need to return these books. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Give them here. \Action-directive_[ad]
 Here they are. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
 It appears these books are two weeks late. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I forgot they were due. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 You do realize you are going to have to pay late fees, right? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 How much is the late fee? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 The late fee is 25 cents a day. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 So I have to pay 25 cents for each day the books are late? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 It's 25 cents for each book. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 That's a lot of money. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 What can I do for you? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 I'm returning these books. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Let me have them. \Action-directive_[ad]
 Here are all of them. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
 These books are two weeks late. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I didn't have time to return them. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 You're going to have to pay late fees. \Action-directive_[ad]
 How much? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 25 cents a day. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 25 cents a day? \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
 That means 25 cents for each late book. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 That's expensive. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
 May I help you with something? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 I would like to return some books. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I'll take them. \Action-directive_[ad]
 Here you go. \Other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
 These books were due two weeks ago. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Yeah. I totally forgot they were due. \Yes answers_[ny]
 You will need to pay late fees on these books. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 How much are the late fees? \Wh-Question_[qw]
 The fee is 25 cents every day. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I have to pay 25 cents a day? \Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 And that's for each book that is late. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 That shouldn't be a problem. \Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 If I want to buy this car, what will it cost me? /other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
 Let me get my contract out, and we'll figure that out for you right now. /Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Can't you just tell me what it costs? /Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 You know, I am prepared to offer you a great deal today on that car. With tax, license, registration, and dealer prep, the total will be fifteen thousand dollars. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Fine, I'll come back later with my father, who is a lawyer, and we can talk then. /other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
 I am sure that we can work something out. What price were you thinking would be a good deal for you? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 Thirteen thousand would be more like it. /Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Fourteen thousand for this car is a good price. For that I am practically giving it away. /Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Normally that would be a good price, but that car has been in an accident. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Yes, I see your point. Thirteen thousand seven hundred and fifty is my final offer. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
  How much money for this car? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 Yes, that car is beautiful, isn't it? Come on inside and we'll discuss the price. /Statement-opinion_[sv]
 I just want to know the price. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Fifteen thousand out the door! What a deal! That will, of course, include tax, license, registration, and dealer prep. /Statement-opinion_[sv]
 I appreciate your help, and I'll see you later. /Appreciation_[ba]
 Oh, you look like a smart person. What price would be fair to you? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 I think that thirteen thousand would be fair for this car. /Statement-opinion_[sv]
 I can see that you are a smart buyer. Fourteen thousand is my best price. /Statement-opinion_[sv]
 If the car hadn't been in an accident, that would be a good price, but it has a few minor problems. /Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Thirteen thousand seven hundred and fifty is my final offer. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 This car is exactly what I want! /other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
 I am glad that you like it. I've had good experiences with this car./Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 So, how much do you want for the car? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 Well, the price in the paper was five thousand dollars. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Yes, I know, but I think that might be a little high for this car./Statement-opinion_[sv]
 I might be able to come down a little on the price. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 How about selling the car for four thousand? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 No, that's way less than I could accept. However, I could accept forty-five hundred. /Statement-opinion_[sv]
 That sounds fair to me. /Statement-opinion_[sv]
 It's a deal then. Thank you! /Thanking_[ft]
 I really love this car! /Appreciation_[ba]
 Great! I was hoping that it would go to a driver who appreciates it. /Appreciation_[ba]
 How much are you willing to take for the car? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 As I am sure you noticed, the price on the window is five thousand dollars. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Don't you think you could come down a bit on the price? /Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 You seem like a nice person. Maybe I could lower the price a bit. /Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Would you sell it to me for four thousand? /Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 I am thinking more in the line of four thousand five hundred. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I'll take it then! /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Perfect! That works for both of us. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I am definitely interested in buying this car. /Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Wonderful! It's good to find a person who really needs this car. /Statement-opinion_[sv]
 What is the price for this car? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 The price I listed on eBay was five thousand dollars. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I was thinking that maybe you might be willing to lower the price a bit. /Statement-opinion_[sv]
 You know I just got a good deal on my new car. I think I can afford to knock a little off of this car. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I was thinking that four thousand would be a good price. /Statement-opinion_[sv]
 I couldn't go that low, but I could sell it for forty-five hundred. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 That would work well for me. /Statement-opinion_[sv]
 It's done then. I've enjoyed doing business with you. /Appreciation_[ba]
 I need to go to the DMV and don't know how to make an appointment with them. /other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
 First of all you need to figure out if you really need to be there in person. Sometimes you can take care of your business at the Automobile Club or at the DMV website. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 If I do need to go in, how can I make an appointment? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 You can either make an appointment by going online or by calling the phone number listed on their website. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 What if I just show up there? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 If you have all day to wait and a good book to read, that might work for you. /Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Is the DMV open on Saturdays? /Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 Due to state budget cuts, the DMV is no longer open on Saturdays. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I think that you have just convinced me to join the Automobile Club! /Response Acknowledgement_[bk]
 Yes, the Automobile Club takes all the pain out of DMV transactions!/other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
 How can I make an appointment at the DMV? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 You could check the DMV website or see if the Automobile Club could help you. Many things can be taken care of without actually going in to the DMV in person. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 How do I make an appointment if I have to actually go in? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 You have two choices. You can call them at the number listed on their website or you can contact them online. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Can I just walk in and get help? /Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 Without an appointment, you will be waiting for many hours. I would not advise it. /Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Can I take care of this on a Saturday? /Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 Unfortunately, the DMV is no longer open on Saturdays. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 It probably would be easier for me to join the Automobile Club. /Statement-opinion_[sv]
 The Automobile Club has many benefits, and taking care of your DMV transactions is one of the best benefits. /Statement-opinion_[sv]
Can you help me figure out how to make an appointment with the DMV? /Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 I would try to avoid going in to the DMV in person. If you are a member of the Automobile Club, they oftentimes can take care of things for you or you can try the DMV website. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 It would be nice not to have to go in but if I have to, how do I make an appointment? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 The easiest way to contact them is online, but they also have a phone number listed on the website if you prefer to call them on the phone. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 What do they do if you just show up with no appointment?  /Wh-Question_[qw]
 That is not a good way to go. You could be left waiting for many hours and there is no guarantee that they will see you at all! /Statement-opinion_[sv]
 What about going to the DMV on Saturday? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 For a while the DMV was open on Saturday, but not anymore. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I think that the Automobile Club idea was a good suggestion. /Statement-opinion_[sv]
 You should check out the Automobile Club. I think you would enjoy being a member. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I am buying a used car and don't know much about financing it. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I can help you. Do you have a down payment? /Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 Yes, I have saved up three thousand dollars for a down payment. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Good, because you will not be able to get a loan without putting some money down on the car./other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
 I don't know where exactly to get a loan. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Other than friends or family, you can go to a bank, credit union, or use the dealer financing if you bought the car off a car lot. /Statement-opinion_[sv]
 What is the best choice for financing? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 It depends. The worst financing deal is usually at the dealer, but they will oftentimes give you a loan when a bank turns you down. /Statement-opinion_[sv]
 What do I need to have with me when I apply for the loan? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 You will need a recent pay stub and a copy of the pink slip for the car. Before the loan is complete, you will need to show proof of insurance. Good luck! /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Can you help me learn about financing options for a used car? /Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 I would love to help you with what I know. I am assuming that you have a down payment. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Yes, I already borrowed some money from my parents for the down payment. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 That will work. A bank or finance company will not loan you money without a down payment. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I am not sure who will loan money to me. /other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
 You can apply for a loan at a bank, credit union, or approach the used car dealer who sold you the car. You might also try family and friends. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Who offers the best interest rate? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 A credit union will usually give you the best interest rate, but the dealer will almost always give you some type of loan. /other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
 Do I need any documents when I apply for a car loan? /Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 Be sure that you take a recent pay stub and a copy of the pink slip. You will have a few days to produce proof of insurance. Enjoy your new car! /other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
 I need help figuring out how to pay for a used car that I am thinking of buying. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I would be happy to help you. Have you saved up a down payment? /Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 I will be getting money from selling my old car. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 You really need that money so that a bank or finance company will loan you the rest of the money that you need. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Who gives loans out to people wanting to buy cars? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 Usually people go to a bank, credit union, or, if they bought the car at a car lot, they might use the dealer finance company. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 What is the best place to get financing? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 The dealer will charge you a higher interest rate, but sometimes they are your only choice if you are just starting out. /other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
 Will I need some documentation when I apply for the loan? /Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 Just make sure that you bring them your last pay stub and a copy of the pink slip. You can then work on getting insured. Enjoy your new car! /other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
 Could you tell me what window I should go to? /Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 Do you have an appointment? /Wh-Question_[qw] 
 Yes, I have an appointment. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 The DMV windows are set up for different tasks. What are you here to do? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 I need to transfer ownership of a used car. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 I can see that you have all of your forms filled out. Drop the forms in that box, and I will call you when your name comes up. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Thanks for helping me. /Thanking_[ft]
 You are welcome. May I see your current Driver's License? /Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 Here is my license, it is not a very good picture of me! /Statement-opinion_[sv]
 That's a pretty good picture. Just pay the fee over at the last window and you're done! /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 This is my first time at the DMV, and I don't know what window to go to. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 It depends on what you are doing. Did you make an appointment? /Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 I made an appointment last month. /other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
 All of the windows are for specific services. What do you need to do today? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 I just bought a used car and need to transfer the ownership. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 If you just put all of your filled-out forms in the drop box, your name will be called when it comes up. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Thank you, that helps me know what to do. /Thanking_[ft]
 My pleasure. The only other thing I need is your current Driver's License. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Here is my license, it is a very old picture of me! /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 You look good in that picture. Take this over to the last window to pay your fee, and you've finished registering your car. /Appreciation_[ba]
 Could you help direct me to the proper window? /Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 There are different windows for different things. Did you make an appointment on the Internet? /Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 I made my appointment over the Internet. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Different windows will be able to help you with different problems. What do you need help with? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 I need help transferring the ownership of a new car from my friend to myself. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 The signed forms go in the box, and I will call your name in a few minutes. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Thank you for making it seem less confusing. /Statement-opinion_[sv]
 If you would give me your current Driver's License, I will be able to complete the transfer process. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Here is my license, I never really liked that picture! /Statement-opinion_[sv]
 That is a great picture! Take the forms over to the last window to pay your fees and you're finished! /Statement-opinion_[sv]
  Where is the best place to buy a used car? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 I have always purchased my used cars from an advertisement in the paper, but actually you have many options. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Where else could I look for a car? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 You could look on the Internet. Craigslist is best, as most of the cars listed there are sold locally. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 What would be best if I wanted to actually go see a lot of used cars that are for sale? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 The best place is CarMax, which is a very large used car lot. /other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
 Where is CarMax? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 There are many of them. You can look on the Internet or in the phone book for the one closest to you. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 How about the listings on the college bulletin board? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 Actually, that is not a bad way to go, especially near the end of a semester as students are moving away. /Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Can you help me figure out the best place to buy a used car? /Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 There are a lot of different ways to go. I bought my last one from an advertisement in the paper. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 What are my other options for looking for a used car? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 Internet listings are good. Craigslist is pretty good because most of the cars are sold locally. /Statement-opinion_[sv]
 I think that I might actually like to see many used cars together so I can compare them. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 The biggest used car lot is CarMax. I would check that place out. /Statement-opinion_[sv]
 How can I find out where CarMax is? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 Look in the phone book or on the Internet for the one closest to you. There are a lot of them. /other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
 Have you ever seen the listings on the school bulletin board? /Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 The school bulletin board can have some great deals, as many students sell their cars before they return home or as they get better paying jobs. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Where did you buy your last used car? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 I found my last one in an advertisement in the newspaper, but there are a lot of other places to look for used cars. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Besides an advertisement, what else could I do to find a used car? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 My friend bought his used car off of Craigslist. It works out better than eBay because the cars listed are located close by. /Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Is there anywhere I can go to see many used cars all in the same place? /Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 Go to CarMax if you want to see the largest selection of used cars in one place. /Statement-opinion_[sv]
 I don't know where CarMax is. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 CarMax has many car lots in many cities. For the one closest to you, check out the Internet or phone book. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Have you ever known anyone who bought a car off a listing on the university bulletin board? /Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 You can get a good deal there. Especially at the end of the year, when students are selling things and returning home. /Statement-opinion_[sv]
  So how did I do on my driving test? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 Do you want the truth? /Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 Of course, I do. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Well, you really didn't do all that well. /Statement-opinion_[sv]
 How bad did I do? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 To be completely honest, you failed your test. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 How? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 There were a number of reasons. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 What were they? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 Basically, you just can't drive. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Can I have another try? /Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 You can take it in a couple weeks. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 How did I do? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 Do you really want to know? /Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 Yes, I do.  /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 You did pretty bad. /Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Exactly how bad? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 You didn't pass the test. /other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
 I don't understand how I could've failed it. /other_[fo_o_fw_by_bc]
 There are a few reasons why you failed. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 What are the reasons? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 The main reason is the fact that you're a horrible driver. /Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Can I take the test again? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 You'll be able to take the test again in a couple weeks. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Did I do well on my test? /Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 Do you want to know the honest answer? /Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 Why wouldn't I want to know? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 You had pretty bad scores. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Exactly what do you mean by bad? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 You failed. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 How'd I fail it? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 There are a couple of reasons why you didn't pass. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 What did I do wrong? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 To sum it all up, you really just don't know how to drive. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Will I be able to take a retest? /Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 Sure you can, in about two and a half weeks. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Do you want to practice your driving right now? /Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 No problem. We can do it right now. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Are you buckled up? /Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 All right. Now what do I do? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 Start the car. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Which way do you want me to go? /Action-directive_[ad]
 Take a left. /Action-directive_[ad]
 How far do you want me to go? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 I'll tell you when to stop. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Just make sure to tell me beforehand. /Wh-Question_[qw]
 We're back now, so why don't you try parking? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 Well, that was fun. Let's do it again soon. /Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Let's go practice your driving. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 If that's what you want to do, then we can. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Did you buckle your seatbelt? /Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 I'm buckled up. What's next? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 You need to start the car now./Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 What do you want me to do?/Wh-Question_[qw]
 Go left. /Action-directive_[ad]
 How far should I go? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 I'll let you know when I want you to stop. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Tell me before you want me to stop. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 All right, try parking here. /Statement-opinion_[sv]
 Thanks. Let's go driving again tomorrow. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Do you think we can go driving right now? /Yes-No-Question_[qy]
 Yeah, sure. Let's go. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 Buckle up. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
 All right. Now what? /Wh-Question_[qw]
 Now you put the key in the ignition and start the car. /Statement-non-opinion_[sd]
